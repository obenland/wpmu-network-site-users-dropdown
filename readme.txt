Replace the input field for adding existing users to a site with a more comfortable dropdown menu!

== Description ==

This plugin lets you as a network administrator add users to your sites without
having to remember or look up the user's login name. It replaces the input
field with a comfortable dropdown menu, so you can choose between all existing
users that are not yet added to the site.

Don't worry about code overhead or performance issues, the plugin will only be
loaded when a network admin sceen is requested.
